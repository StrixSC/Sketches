# Tutorial: Object Oriented Programming

## About

This project was made and presented for students of a local high school. I was asked to present a project to some students interrested in computer science. The purpose of this small project is to provide students with an easily understandable example of object oriented programming using concepts that the student is familiar with at that age, such as mathematical functions. 

The project is developped with Processing, a very intuitive tool built on Java. Processing is made to empower visual arts and help programmers create easily and facilitate their creative thinking.

Then you can extract the files into a folder and open the files in Processing!
